# Experimenting with Raylib

Ever since I stumbled onto [**Raylib**](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html) on [Github](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), I've been interested in learning more about how it works. 
This repo will chart my journey.

> For reference, the command to **compile a Raylib executable** on Debian is `cc *name-of-file* -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11`.
